<p>You should see three pictures below. If you don't, you either have not
understood the difference between serving a text file and serving a
picture, or you just have not implemented it (properly) yet. In either

<h2>The first picture</h2>

<p><img src="images/lamport.png"/>.</p>

<h2>The second picture</h2>

<p><img src="lamport.gif"/>.</p>

<h2>The third picture</h2>

<p><img src="images/cause-effect.jpg"/>.</p>
