<h1>dDist 2011 - Example Page 1</h1>

<p>This is probably the first page you can serve, as it is very simple
HTML page with no images or other naugtities. When your server gets more
advanced you should also be able to serve the pages linked to below.</p>

<p>Here is a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamps">link</a> out of
the house, which should be a piece of cake as a completely different
server will serve that page to the client.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="page2.html">link</a> to Example Page 2, which
contains pictures.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="page3.html">link</a> to Example Page 3, which
contains a link to documents.</p>

<p>When all the above works your server is approvable. If that was to
little for you, try to make the form work on 
<a href="page4.html">Example Page 4</a> work.

<p>Since we got bored we added the possibility to view folder structures.
  It formats the folders in a similar way as other http servers</p>
<a href="/images">Example Page 5</a>
